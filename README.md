AI-Generated Portfolio Website from Resume

I built an AI-Generated Portfolio Website that automatically converts a resume (PDF/DOCX) into a professional portfolio website.

🔹 Resume text extraction
🔹 Automated website generation (HTML, CSS, JS)
🔹 Live preview & ZIP download

Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, PyPDF2, python-docx, HTML/CSS/JS

I sincerely thank Innomatics Research Labs for continuous support and learning opportunities.
Special thanks to Vishwanath Nyathani, Kalpana Katiki Reddy, SAXON K SHA, and Lakshmi Vangapandu for their guidance and mentorship.
